### 1. `VALID_PASSWORD_REGEX`

```python
VALID_PASSWORD_REGEX = re.compile(r"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}$")
```

This regex is used to validate passwords. Here's what each part of the regex does:

- `^`: Asserts the position at the start of the line.
- `(?=.*[a-z])`: A positive lookahead that ensures there is at least one lowercase letter (`a-z`) anywhere in the string.
- `(?=.*[A-Z])`: A positive lookahead that ensures there is at least one uppercase letter (`A-Z`) anywhere in the string.
- `(?=.*\d)`: A positive lookahead that ensures there is at least one digit (`\d` is shorthand for `[0-9]`) anywhere in the string.
- `.{8,}`: Matches any character (except for line terminators) at least 8 times. This asserts that the string has a minimum length of 8 characters.
- `$`: Asserts the position at the end of the line.

Overall, this regex checks that a password has:

- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one digit
- A minimum length of 8 characters

### 2. `VALID_NAME_REGEX`

```python
VALID_NAME_REGEX = re.compile(r"^[a-zA-Z]{2,}$")
```

This regex is used to validate names. Here’s the breakdown:

- `^`: Asserts the position at the start of the line.
- `[a-zA-Z]`: Matches any alphabetical character either lowercase (`a-z`) or uppercase (`A-Z`).
- `{2,}`: Ensures that the preceding character class `[a-zA-Z]` appears at least 2 times, which sets the minimum length of the name to be 2 characters.
- `$`: Asserts the position at the end of the line.

This regex ensures that a name consists only of alphabetic characters and is at least two characters long.

These regular expressions are quite common in applications for validating user inputs, such as during account registration processes, ensuring that inputs conform to security standards or expected formats.

### 3. `More Details`

The construction `(?=.*[a-z])` found in the password regex is an example of what is generally called a "lookahead assertion" in regular expressions. Specifically, this is a "positive lookahead."

Here's the breakdown of `(?=.*[a-z])`:

- `(?= ... )`: This is the syntax for a positive lookahead. What it does is tell the regex engine to look ahead from the current position in the string and check if the sequence inside the parenthesis can be matched without consuming any characters of the string for the main regex pattern (i.e., the regex engine's position remains unchanged after checking). It's only checking ahead to see if the pattern could match later in the string.
- `.*`: This matches any character (except newlines by default) zero or more times (`*` means "zero or more"). The dot `.` stands for "any single character". When put together, `.*` allows the pattern to march forward looking through all characters, effectively allowing the following part of the pattern to potentially match anywhere in the string after the current position.

- `[a-z]`: This matches any single character in the range from 'a' to 'z', representing all lowercase letters.

So when you bring it together in `(?=.*[a-z])`, this pattern is checking "ahead" from the current position to see if there is at least one lowercase letter anywhere in the string following the current position. The use of `.*` before `[a-z]` allows for any characters (or no character) to exist before an occurrence of a lower case letter, hence checking throughout the entire string as it confirms the pattern from the start due to `^`.

This lookahead mechanism allows you to impose additional conditions on the string being examined without actually affecting the main pattern’s position in the string—think of it as a "checklist" item that needs to be ticked off but doesn’t affect where you are in the line.

In the context of the regex for the password (`^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}$`), this technique is used to ensure that the password contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit anywhere in the string while enforcing a minimum length of 8 characters. Each lookahead (`(?=.*[A-Z])`, `(?=.*\d)`) performs a similar check for uppercase letters and digits, respectively.
